# Modern Tooling Roadmap

## Objectives
We want to introduce a maintainable frontend toolchain (TypeScript, Vite, Biome, PostCSS) without altering the current user experience. Our north star for today is to stand up the tooling scaffolding, keep the existing HTML demo verifiable, and equip the team with a reproducible developer environment via Dev Containers and Codespaces.

## Baseline & Risk Controls
- Relocate the legacy entry points into `legacy_html/` while keeping their internal layouts intact (e.g., `legacy_html/herakoi_web_three_channels/html`, `legacy_html/herakoi_web_test/herakoi.html`, `legacy_html/test_imgs`, `legacy_html/README.md`). This lets us reference behaviours without editing the historic files.
- Treat everything inside `legacy_html/` as read-only reference material. New UI work will land inside modular TypeScript views under `src/`, even when we are chasing feature parity. We compare outputs but never copy/paste entire legacy blocks forward.
- Define a manual smoke checklist covering image upload, webcam feed, and slider updates; we will run it before and after each major change.
- Capture written notes on any regressions we spot during manual testing so we can translate them into automated coverage later.

## Tooling Workstream
1. **TypeScript adoption**  
   - Introduce a `/src` workspace with Vite’s vanilla-ts template, then rebuild UI controllers as small modules that consume the same data/DOM contract the legacy demos expose. We reference the legacy scripts for behaviour, not for copy/paste ports.  
   - Configure strict TypeScript settings but temporarily allow `any` so we unblock MediaPipe prototype code. Track follow-up tasks to tighten types as modules stabilize.
2. **Vite build pipeline**  
   - Scaffold Vite in the repo root, mapping `public/assets` for static files.  
   - Adopt `pnpm` for dependency management so we share lockfiles across platforms and benefit from the content-addressable store.  
   - Create parity entry points (`main.ts`, `style.css`) that replicate the current UI while using Vite’s dev server for HMR.
3. **Biome formatting & linting**  
   - Add a project-level `biome.json` mirroring two-space indentation and the narrative comment style from `AGENTS.md`.  
   - Wire Biome into `package.json` scripts (`lint`, `format`) and into the pre-commit hook queue once adopted.
4. **PostCSS pipeline**  
   - Configure PostCSS with autoprefixer and nesting support to simplify responsive tweaks.  
   - Document how legacy CSS lives within the new pipeline, and schedule the migration of inline styles into modular files.
5. **Testing suggestions**  
   - Add Vitest for unit coverage of helper utilities as they emerge.  
   - Keep Playwright on the radar for later regression testing once the TypeScript refactor settles.

## Migration Phases
1. **Tooling bootstrap**  
   - Stand up Vite + TypeScript with pnpm and PostCSS, serving a simple “Hello, Herakoi” page as the default entry (`index.html`) to validate the pipeline.  
   - Wire Biome lint/format scripts and document the new commands.
2. **One-channel parity build**  
   - Configure a second Vite HTML entry (e.g., `one-channel.html`) that reimplements `legacy_html/herakoi_web_test/herakoi.html` with fresh modules (vision, audio, UI) while importing assets from the legacy directory as needed.  
   - Run the manual smoke checklist against both the new modular build and the legacy page to ensure behaviour stays aligned.
3. **Multi-channel modularization**  
   - Add a third Vite entry (e.g., `three-channels.html`) composed of the new modules, matching the behaviour of `legacy_html/herakoi_web_three_channels/html/index.html` without transplanting markup wholesale.  
   - Keep the legacy folder untouched for regression comparison; document any divergence so future modular components remain the single source of truth.

## Environment & Dev Experience
- Author a `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` that installs Node.js 22 LTS, Biome, and Docker CLI tooling; mount the repo and configure post-create commands to run `pnpm install`.  
- Mirror the configuration in a `devcontainer.json` at the repo root for Codespaces users.  
- Provide workspace recommendations (VS Code extensions, Biome formatter integration) in the Dev Container features.
- Draft a top-level `README.md` that explains the modern toolchain, how legacy references fit in, and where to find the GitHub Pages preview once it exists.
- Reflect any new workflow expectations inside `AGENTS.md` so every agent sees the requirement to update this plan before acting.

## Publishing Progress
- Add a GitHub Pages workflow that runs `pnpm build`, uploads the `dist/` artifact, and deploys it whenever `main` updates or the workflow is manually dispatched. This keeps stakeholders informed without cloning the repo.  
- Once the first deployment lands, document the public URL in `README.md` so designers and testers know where to find the latest sandbox.

## Delivery Strategy
- Ship the modernization as a single, well-structured pull request so reviewers can follow the end-to-end toolchain upgrade in one place.
- Keep commit boundaries tight (e.g., legacy verification doc, tooling scaffold, devcontainer) to simplify review and bisecting if issues appear.
- Close with updated documentation and manual test notes before requesting approval.
- Treat a green GitHub Pages deployment as part of the review checklist; it proves the build still works in CI and the published sandbox is fresh.
- Require the plan in `docs/improvement-plan-pr1.md` to stay current throughout the workstream—new tasks land there first, and engineers wait for confirmation before acting on significant additions.
- Reflect any new workflow expectations inside `AGENTS.md` so every agent sees the requirement to update this plan before acting.

## Plan Completion Checklist
- Flesh out the manual smoke checklist (steps, expected results, owners) so parity reviews stay repeatable.  
- Add the timeline for multi-channel modularization and list dependencies (e.g., audio refactors, MediaPipe experiments).  
- Capture the exact GitHub Pages rollout owner plus fallback reviewer, then link to the workflow once implemented.
